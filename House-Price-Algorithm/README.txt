The housing prices in Palo Alto are some of the highest in the United States.
Something that could be useful for prospective home buyers is an algorithm that
could predict a fair price for a house in the region. I used the data from home
sales in Palo Alto from Realtor.com to train a scikit-learn linear regression model.
The values inputted in shell are then parsed through the model to predict the price
of a house in Palo Alto with those specifications.
