This is the final project I developed in my Computational Functional
Genomic class. The goal was to analyze the expression differences 
between two cells types from the Tabula Muris Consortium Mouse scRNA
dataset. I chose to compare granulocytes to B-cells for this project.
The code is contained in the Jupiter notebook file and the paper on
this analysis is the pdf file in this folder.
