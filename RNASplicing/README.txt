This program follows a practice program on Rosalind on 
reading a raw RNA transcript along with the introns from 
a mock FASTA file. The goal is to use the introns to splice the RNA
and translate it to yield the protein sequence. The data
folder contains the mock FASTA file such that the first
entry is the RNA transcript and all the rest of the entries
are the introns. The program uses DNA coding so codons are
encoded in T's.
